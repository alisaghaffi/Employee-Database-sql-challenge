/*
As you examine the data, you begin to suspect that the dataset is fake.
Maybe your boss gave you spurious data in order to test the data engineering skills of a new employee? 
To confirm your hunch, you decide to create a visualization of the data to present to your boss. Follow these steps:

Import the SQL database into Pandas. (Yes, you could read the CSVs directly in Pandas,
but you are, after all, trying to prove your technical mettle.) This step may require some research.
Feel free to use the following code to get started. 
Be sure to make any necessary modifications for your username, password, host, port, and database name:

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('postgresql://localhost:5432/<your_db_name>')

engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/EmployeeSQL')

connection = engine.connect()
Consult the SQLAlchemy documentation for more information.

If youâ€™re using a password, do not upload your password to your GitHub repository.
Review this video and the GitHub website for more information.

1-Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.

             use    details_of_employee_by_salary view

2-Create a bar chart of average salary by title.

             use below code : List_of_emp_salary_title
